**What** 
What is service mesh
Helps with traffic management of k8s cluster (East-West traffic), 

The traffic comes from outside the k8s cluster is know as North-South traffic.
The internal traffic between one service to another is called East-West traffic.

**Why**
istio provides MTLS,MutualTLS
A certificate is provided to each service in k8s cluster by istio for secure communication.

It provides advanced deployment strategies like canary, A-B, blue green.
canary - we are directing 10% of traffic to new version and checking, eventually we are increasing the traffice to new version based on the performance of new version.

Kiali is well integrated with istio, keep track of service to service communication.

**How**
Istio provides a container to all pod, whichever namespace it has access to. That container is called side-car container. 

The side-car container has Envoy proxy application.

This proxy service, manages the traffic of the pod(ALL inbound and outbound traffic) OBSERVABILITY.

All the side-car containers sends the information to the IstioD(primary component of Istio, keep track of this obervability.

Communication between Istio and API server in k8s cluster -> Admission Controller 
Whenever a user apply a deployment manifest to the k8s cluster, API server checks the auth and authorization, if it is valid request store the data in etcd.
Admisssion controller, after the auth is verified,  mutate or validates the objects.
If some necessary fields(not mandatory) are not present in the manifest, admission controller mutates  and creates it.
In case of resource qouta, if we restrict the Computations, this admission controller validates and throws the error.

Download the istio resource folder from the follosing link
```
https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.22.0
```
For this installation, we use the demo configuration profile. Itâ€™s selected to have a good set of defaults for testing, but there are other profiles for production or performance testing.
```
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
```

Add a namespace label to instruct Istio to automatically inject Envoy sidecar proxies when you deploy your application in default namespace:
```
 kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```


[Link for the example , provided by Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/)

Go to inside the Istio resource folder, where samples folder is present and deploy the application
```
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
```
If, you can't see the pods, the  automatic sidecar injection during installation is disabled and rely on manual sidecar injection, use the istioctl kube-inject command to modify the bookinfo.yaml file before deploying your application.
```
kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml)
```
if the folder does not have full access, the above command will be executed fully and sidecar injection is not done.

In Windows system, 
Run istioctl kube-inject and Save the Output Using Redirection:
```
istioctl kube-inject -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml > bookinfo-injected.yaml
```
A new file is generated in the current folder. Deploy the current generated file to the k8s cluster, you can see sidecar container in each pod.

If you are using gke, auto pilot, we need to enable the service mesh capabalities to the k8s cluster by the following command .
```
gcloud container clusters update <ClusterName> --region <RegionName> --workload-policies=allow-net-admin
```
