The idea behind chaos engineering is to intentionally introduce failures into a system to identify weaknesses and potential points of failure, aiming to improve overall reliability.

Chaos engineering deliberately introduces chaos into a system to test its resilience and reliability. The goal is to create a controlled environment where engineers can test how a system responds to various types of failures, ranging from small-scale issues like a single server going down to larger-scale problems like an entire data center going offline.
