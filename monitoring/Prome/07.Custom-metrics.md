performance indicators that are not covered by default metrics

There are 4 custom metrics, 
1. Counter
2. Guage
3. Histogram
4. Summary


**Counter** : used to count, eg: number of count, no of items created. THis valus is increased or reset to zero, on application restart.

**Guage**:  A metric that can go up or down, useful for tracking values like current temperature or number of active connections. Eg: memory uage of application, pending list of carrt

**Histogram**: A metric that samples observations (e.g., request duration) and counts them in configurable buckets.
